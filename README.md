## Game Design Document

### Game Concept

On this game, you are Bob the octopus, and you are in a quest to find a treasure in the 16-bit layout deep sea. You need to face some sea creatures in order to achieve your goal, and you can kill the creatures by shooting ink from our hero and interact with levers on the scenario to open paths. You have a limited time to complete the quest.


### How to play

- To move our character you should use the left and right arrow keys on your keyboard.
- You can jump with the up arrow key, you can do one extra jump while on air performing a 'double jump'.
- To shoot an 'ink bullet' you should press the space key on your keyboard.

#### Interactive Scenario
